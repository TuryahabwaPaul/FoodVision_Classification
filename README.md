## 🚀 Project Overview
The **FoodVision - Maconi Project** is a deep learning endeavor aiming to develop a robust food classification model. Using a curated food image dataset, we applied modern data preprocessing techniques and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately identify different food items.

### 📝 Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, and augment food images for optimal model performance.
- **Model Building**: Craft a CNN architecture tailored for image classification.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Track model performance and adjust hyperparameters to achieve the best results.
- **Predictions**: Classify unseen food images with the trained model.
- **Deployment-Ready**: The model is prepped for easy deployment to classify food in real-time.

## 💾 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a diverse set of food images, split into:

- **Training Set**: Used to train the model.
- **Validation Set**: Helps tune hyperparameters.
- **Test Set**: Final performance evaluation.

Each image is resized and normalized for input into our neural network.

## 🛠️ Model Architecture

We utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following components:

- **🔍 Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input food images.
- **🔄 Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions, retaining essential information.
- **🧠 Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers to classify the extracted features into food categories.

### Model Configuration:

- **Loss Function**: `Categorical Cross-Entropy`
- **Optimizer**: `Adam`
- **Metrics**: `Accuracy`
